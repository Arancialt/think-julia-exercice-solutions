# To check your understanding, type the following statements in the Julia REPL and see what they do:

5
x = 5
x + 1 # = 6

#Now put the same statements in a script and run it. What is the output? Modify the script by transforming each expression into a print statement and then run it again.

println(5) # 5
println(x = 5) # Error: function println does not accept keyword arguments
println(x + 1) # = 6
