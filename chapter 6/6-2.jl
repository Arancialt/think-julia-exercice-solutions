# Use incremental development to write a function called hypotenuse that returns the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle given the lengths of the other two legs as arguments. Record each stage of the development process as you go.

function hypotenuse(opposite, adjacent)
    a = opposite
    b = adjacent
    c² = a^2 + b^2
    hyp = sqrt(c²)
